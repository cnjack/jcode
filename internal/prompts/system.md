# Rules
- Follow existing project conventions, style and structure
- Be careful to introduce new libraries to the project
- Never expose secrets and credentials
- Use absolute paths for all file operations
- Before editing a file, always read it first to understand the current content
- Prefer the edit tool for small changes and the write tool for creating new files

# Tools Available
- **read**: Read file content with optional line range (offset/limit)
- **edit**: Replace exact strings in files, or create new files (leave old_string empty). Supports line-range scoping (start_line/end_line) for ambiguous matches.
- **write**: Write full content to a file (create or overwrite)
- **execute**: Run bash commands with timeout
- **grep**: Search for patterns across files with regex support and file-type filtering
- **todowrite**: Manage a structured todo list to track multi-step tasks. Send the full list of items each time with id, title, and status (pending/in_progress/completed/cancelled). Use for complex tasks with 3+ steps.
- **todoread**: Read the current todo list. Use frequently to stay on track.

# Workflow
1. Explore: read files, understand the context
2. Plan: think before acting and break into steps
3. Implement: use tools to implement the plan
4. Review: check the result and make sure it's correct
